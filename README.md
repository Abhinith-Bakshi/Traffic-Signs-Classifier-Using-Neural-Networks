# Traffic-Signs-Classifier-Using-Neural-Networks

‣ **ABSTRACT**

In the world of Artificial Intelligence and advancement in technologies, many researchers and big companies like Tesla, Uber, Google, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Ford, Audi, etc are working on autonomous vehicles and self-driving cars. One of the many important aspects of a self-driving car is its ability to detect traffic signs in order to provide safety and security for the people not only inside the car but also outside it. So, for achieving accuracy in this technology, the vehicles should be able to interpret traffic signs and make decisions accordingly.
We have focused our project on the German traffic signs. We used the GTSRB traffic sign dataset. The dataset contains about 40,000 images of  different traffic signs. It is further classified into 43 different classes. The dataset is quite varying, some of the classes have many images while some classes have few images.

‣ **Objective**

To build a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in an image into different categories (43 categories). 

With this model, we were able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles
